<h4>Apple is the first major computer company to make Open Source development a major part of its software strategy and is continuing to use this same strategy. The major components of Mac OS X are all under Apple’s Open Source license. One of the Open source projects included is the Apache, which can only be used in version 2.2.19. Another open source project is glibtool which is used under version 2.2.10 and can also be used in Xcode Tools.</h4>

<h4>With the Lion Server you can create Netinstall or NetRestore images for mass deployment of OS X Lion Server and Lion Server. Netinstall images can be used to download OS X and Lion Server and other various other packages. You can use Netinstall images to upgrade the volume of a previous version of Mac OS X without deleting it’s first version. NetRestore is used to delete the destination volume as well as making a block copy of a pre-installed system over the network. The NetRestores are much faster than NetImages and is preferable.  </h4>
